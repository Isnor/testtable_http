# HTTP testtable
[testtable](https://github.com/Isnor/testtable) for JSON endpoints

## Overview
This module is an extension of another project of mine, [testtable](https://github.com/Isnor/testtable). The hope is that it makes writing tests for REST APIs simpler, easier to refactor, and without the boilerplate and autogenerated code that is common in Go projects.
